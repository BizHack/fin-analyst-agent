Create a Python app that does the following:

- Build a simple Flask web server with a modern, clean-looking UI (use Bootstrap or similar if needed).
- Name the homepage "TrainingUp.ai - Market Signal Intelligence".
- Homepage should have 4 main tabs:
  1. **Sentiment**: Analyze recent social media posts from Reddit, Twitter, Truth Social. Show top 5 posts related to a selected ticker. Display a short paragraph summary of market sentiment for that ticker.
  2. **Politician Trades**: Monitor latest U.S. politician stock trades. Show the last 5 trades and provide a short paragraph highlight for a selected ticker.
  3. **Technical Analysis**: Analyze price action and pattern detection for a selected ticker. Display a paragraph summary (e.g., support/resistance or breakout pattern detection).
  4. **Fundamentals**: Analyze earnings call results or key financials of a selected ticker. Summarize a paragraph of highlights for that ticker.

- Also, on the homepage, outside of tabs, create three quick sections:
  - "Politician Posts Monitor" (shows last 5 analyzed political posts or trades)
  - "Market Movements" (shows latest SPY, Bitcoin, Gold prices)
  - "Agent Insights" (short list of real-time alerts from agents)

- Add a button "Analyze New Event" that simulates a new social post or market move and triggers analysis.

- Organize the project into these folders:
  - /agents (for different mini agents like TrumpPostAgent, VolumeSpikeAgent, NewsAgent)
  - /data (temporary datasets and saved analysis)
  - /models (future ML models for pattern prediction)
  - /static (CSS, JS if needed)
  - /templates (Flask HTML templates)

- Install and use necessary packages: flask, yfinance, requests.

- Create a placeholder Python file in /agents called trump_agent.py.

- Design the UI to be attractive and easy to navigate, using Bootstrap cards, tabs, and clean layouts.

The purpose of the project is to track political, social media, technical, and fundamental signals and their impact on financial markets, and to display real-time insights.
